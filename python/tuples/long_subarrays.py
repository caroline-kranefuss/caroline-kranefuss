# Problem 0-6. An increasing subarray of an integer array is any consecutive sequence of array integers whose values strictly increase. 
# Write Python function count long subarrays(A) which accepts Python Tuple A=(a0,a1,...,anâˆ’1) of n> 0 positive integers, 
# and returns the number of longest increasing subarrays of A, i.e., the number of increasing subarrays with length at least as large as every other increasing subarray. 
# For example, if A = (1,3,4,2,7,5,6,9,8), your program should return 2 since the maximum length of any increasing subarray of A is three and there are two increasing subarrays with that length: specifically, subarrays (1,3,4) and (5,6,9). 

def count_long_subarrays(A):
    # define variables: 
        # the length of A, a list to store the first sequence, a temp list to store subsequent values, the number of subarrays, and the size of that first subarray
    n = len(A)
    first_sequence = []
    temp = []
    num_subarrays = 0
    # start by appending the first element to temp
    first_sequence.append(A[0])
    temp.append(A[0])

    # THIS IS THE FIRST ITERATION OF THE CODE TO FIND THE LENGTH OF THE FIRST SEQUENCE
    # add elements to the temp array one by one
    # but first check if the next number is greater than the previous number
    # if it is, store it in temp
    # going from 0 to the length of A
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if i == 0:
            pass
        # if the number following the previous one is bigger, append it to temp and increment num_subarrays
