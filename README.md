The function of this site is to demonstrate my explorations in various programming languages.
Projects are organized by language and the main skill demonstrated.
Please explore!
A good place to start is in the "Highlighted" folder, where some of my favorite projects are stored.


About my present:

I am a Master of Science student at the University of Virginia's School of Data Science, where I am or will be enrolled in Understanding Uncertainty (Probability and Statistics); Machine Learning I, II, and III; Ethics of Big Data; Text as Data (Natural Language Processing (NLP)) and Data Engineering I and II. Languages utilized include Python, R, and SQL.


About my past:

I taught myself Python through an online self-paced version of Harvard College's Introduction to Programming with Python course. I also used it in my roles as a Data Analyst at Gentuity, LLC and a Computational Neuroimaging Data Analyst at Massachusetts General Hospital. 

I learned Java through an Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms with Java at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. 

I taught myself amount of C through an online self-paced version of Harvard College's Introduction to Programming with C course.

I self-taught SQL in my prior roles as well; though not displayed in my GitHub, I love this langauge and the many results that can come from its queries.

I also worked with MATLAB in a prior role as a Computational Neuroimaging Data Analyst.
