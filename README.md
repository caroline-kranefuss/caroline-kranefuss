The function of this site is to demonstrate my proficiency in various programming languages.
Projects are organized by language and the main skill demonstrated.

I taught myself Python through an online self-paced version of Harvard College's Introduction to Programming with Python course. I also used it in my roles as a Data Analyst at Smarter Travel and a Data Analyst II at Gentuity, LLC. Finally, I currently use it in my role as a Computational Neuroimaging Data Analyst. 

I learned Java through an Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms with Java at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. 

I taught myself a small amount of C through an online self-paced version of Harvard College's Introduction to Programming with C course; I did not complete this course, having decided that it made more sense to complete a course in Python.

I self-taught SQL in my prior roles as well; though not displayed in my GitHub, I love this langauge and the many results that can come from its queries.

I work with MATLAB and R in my current role as a Computational Neuroimaging Data Analyst. The code I write for this role is proprietary information of Massachusetts General Hospital and is thus not displayed.
